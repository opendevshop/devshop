# DevShop BinTools

The DevShop BinTools package provides a standardized set of shell scripts that
are useful for DevOps tasks.

These scripts are used by the DevShop [Docker containers](../docker) and [Ansible roles](../roles),
but were designed to be used by anyone.

## Docker Bin Tools

There are more Docker-specific bin tools available in the [docker/bin](../docker/bin) folder.
