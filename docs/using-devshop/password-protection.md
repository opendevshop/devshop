# Password Protection

DevShop allows you to password protect your sites with an "HTTP Password".

This prevents anyone \(including search engines\) from accessing any page unless they know the password.

## Adding a Password to an Environment

To add a HTTP Password to an environment:

1. Visit the Project Dashboard.
2. Click an environment's _Environment Settings_ icon ![Push this button to open Environment Settings.](../.gitbook/assets/settings%20%282%29.png) icon.
3. Click _Environment Settings_.
4. Scroll toward the bottom of the form.
5. Look for the section _HTTP Basic Authentication_.
6. Enter a username and password, and a message if you wish.
7. Click "Save".
8. Wait for the environment to complete verification.
9. Visit the site and confirm that the browser asks you for a username and password.

## Removing a Password from an Environment

To remove the password, simply empty the "username" and "password" fields from the environment settings form.
