# Acquia Cloud Hooks Integration

## Acquia Cloud Hooks Integration

DevShop now supports firing Acquia Cloud Hooks when deploying to environments.

The code in acquia.drush.inc will detect an acquia repo and trigger your hooks to run.

See the Acquia Cloud Hooks repository for more information and samples: [https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks](https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks)
