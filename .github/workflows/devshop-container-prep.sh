# Create a local branch in the "path" repo so that composer doesn't get all confused. When the path is a SHA, composer reads the version as `devshop/devmaster[dev-8207dc45845c7cc0e4e8271d9c097fcb108a5773]`
# Assumption: Having a local branch will make composer detect the devshop/devmaster repo as being at version `devshop/devmaster[1.x-dev]`.
# I discovered this is happening by noticing that local composer install fails had a different error message:
# In GitHub Actions: https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/pull/629/checks?check_run_id=1392567826#step:4:227
#   - Root composer.json requires devshop/devmaster ^1.7@alpha||1.x-dev, it is satisfiable by devshop/devmaster[1.7.0-alpha1, 1.7.0-alpha2, 1.7.0-alpha3, 1.x-dev] from composer repo (https://repo.packagist.org) but devshop/devmaster[dev-8207dc45845c7cc0e4e8271d9c097fcb108a5773] from path repo (/usr/share/devshop/devmaster) has higher repository priority.
# Locally, it says `devshop/devmaster[1.x-dev]` instead, because my local path repo is on a branch.
