- Community
  - Created [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/devshop) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/devshop) pages, BACKERS.md, and added links to GetDevShop.com, the install scripts, and the web UI! 
  - Your support makes DevShop possible. Please become a backer or a sponsor today! 
  - https://opencollective.com/devshop or https://patreon.com/devshop
  - New widget in DevShop to encourage contributors and Activate Support.
  
  ![Support the Collective Widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevshop/documentation/master/images/support-the-collective.png)

- Features
  - Global "drush" is now loaded from the DevShop `bin` directory! This means the drush version is defined in 
    `composer.json` and no longer needs to be installed or maintained separately.
  - NodeJS and NPM now come pre-installed in the same way! We now install Node and NPM by default on all devshop servers 
    using composer.
  - The DevShop CLI "bin" path is now added across environments, and drush, node, and 
    npm are all installed there, managed by composer.json, using the "nodejs-installer" package! If you need a different
    version, you can include it in your own project. [More information on nodejs-installer for composer](https://packagist.org/packages/mouf/nodejs-installer)
  - Added "DevShop Settings" link to footer so users without admin menu permission can access it.
  - On "Create Environment" form, default to "Clone Environment" and show the full URL instead of a "View" text. Much better for remote aliases.
- Create Project page overhaul:
  
  ![Create new repos right in devshop from composer or other repos.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106420/56436137-d8a17b00-62a8-11e9-8167-a68f39e62ac3.gif)
  - Add ability to start a project by choosing from existing GitHub repos!
  - Add ability to create new GitHub repos from Composer projects or cloned from other git repositories!!!
  - Added "Chosen" widget to allow quick searching of large lists of repos and branches/tags. (Environment deploy widget coming soon!)
  - Maintain the list of suggested composer projects or git repos on the settings page. This serves as a git repo template system for new projects.
  
  ![Configure git repo or composer project templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevshop/documentation/master/images/Suggested-projects-repos.png)
  - Added a welcome message explaining what a project is.
  - Moved the Git Repo URL to first, and automatically create a project code name from that.
  - Dynamically force project codenames to be lowercase and not have punctuation.
  - Rewrite and redesign of DevShop GitHub settings page. Fixed bug blocking SSH key from being detected and added properly. - Cleaned up tips, standardized the SSH key check UX.
  
  ![New GitHub Settings Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevshop/documentation/master/images/github-settings.png)
  
  - Automatically load servers SSH Public Key and save it into the Devmaster front end: the user no longer has to do this manually, it happens on hostmaster verify.
  - Add spinner graphics to the two "Create Project" steps that need it!
  - Fixed "Refreshing..." branches UI that would only show if you viewed the project node before the git references were loaded.
  - Changed "Path to Drupal" setting to "Document Root". Much more clear and accurate.
  - Total rewrite of `install.sh` by @vmmello to add a `--help` option and break everything into bash functions. Thanks Vinicius!

- Bug Fixes:
    - Added ability to remove devshop.support license key.
    - Fixed bad project/platform links on Platform node pages.
    - Stop hiding successful verify and login tasks from the UI so it doesn't look broken!
    - Fix bug in travis tests for forked repos.
    - Removed deprecation notices for "Install extra packages" in devmaster ansible role.
    - 
- Bumping Drupal core to 7.67

- DevShop.Support Release Candidate!
    - This release marks the launch of the DevShop.Support Network. It includes an open source module, DevShop Support Network Client, that enables monitoring & single-sign-on.
- Major `install.sh` improvements:
    - Creates a simple inventory file at `/etc/ansible/hosts`.
    - Ansible galaxy roles are installed to `/etc/ansible/roles`.
    - Ansible vars are saved to `/etc/ansible/host_vars` and `/etc/ansible/group_vars/devmaster`
    - Changed the ansible output to "unixy", it's now MUCH more clear what is happening behind the ansible curtain.
    - New `--install-path` option to allow customizing the CLI destination (Defaults to `/usr/share/devshop`). This was needed for full install.sh/ansible upgrade testing.
    - New `--ansible-default-host-list` option to define where to save the ansible inventory file. Defaults to `/etc/ansible/hosts`.
    - New `--force-ansible-role-install` option adds the `--force` option to the `ansible-galaxy install` command, causing the script to overwrite existing roles. Defaults to False.
    - New `--license` option, used for immediate setup of DevShop Support network! See https://devshop.support for more information.
    - Added `set -e` so it will actually fail if any line in the script fails.
- Major DevShop CLI improvements.
    - Added `devshop devmaster:upgrade` to specifically update the devmaster drupal site. This is a replacement for `drush hostmaster-migrate` that should not be run manually. It is triggered during the updated `devshop upgrade` command.
    - Allow upgrading by running the playbook with the new version as the `devshop_version` variable. The playbook now detects an existing devmaster installation and runs the devmaster upgrade command automatically.
    - Add the new ansible-playbook upgrade method Travis.yml for testing.
    - Improve the `devshop self-update` command: add `--ignore-working-copy-changes` to make development easier and added `composer install` call after git checkout. 
    - Change the devmaster folder variant to "date('Y-m-d-Hi');" to match what the provision debian package does.
    - Change `devshop upgrade` command to run the entire upgrade process: self-update the CLI, then invoke a new process (so it uses the new code) for `devshop verify:system`.
    - Improved `devshop verify:system` command. Added `--connection` option to allow customizing the ansible `--connection` option, automatically write `ansible.cfg` file, automatically create inventory and vars files, and automatically create the mysql root password if there isn't one.
    - Improved the Application class, it now properly detects the version from the Git Reference, and displays the exact SHA.
    - Removed the silly "over 30 days old" warning.
    - Improved Command class, including ansible, IO, and FS properties.
    - Reduced GitHub API calls when running automated tests.
    - Added our fork of the asm/php-ansible packagist library so we can use the `devshop verify:system` command again.
- Docker & Local Tools improvements:
    - Added our own Dockerfile for the devshop/server container: a single container with all services. See Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.  This is awesome because it installs every version of PHP in a single container. This will soon become the default, and you will be able to choose the version of PHP you want from the Site Node form.
    - Improved the Robofile to be more visible about what it is doing. There is a lot of yelling now.
    - Got the vagrant environment working again! See `vagrant` folder. It should be ready for `vagrant up`.
    - Added missing packages to the build-devmaster-dev.make.yml and build-devmaster-travis-forks.make.yml file (only used in development).
    - In the docker-compose.yml file (for development), map $HOME/.ssh to /var/aegir/.ssh so the container inherits the users SSH folder.

- Devmaster Improvements:
    - Updating Drupal core to 7.61. Updated features, libraries, intercomio, and bootstrap theme.
    - Added statsd.module and created Hosting StatsD module for sending statistics to a Graphite server. 
    - Updated and released a new version of IntercomIO module.
    - Default devmaster to enable HTTPS and LetsEncrypt.org! If DevShop is installed on a server with public DNS, it will have a valid HTTPS certificate out of the box! The devmaster.profile file automatically detects a public devshop and enables LetsEncrypt on the hostmaster site for you.
    - Update Hosting modules to 3.17.0. See full release notes here: http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/release-notes/3.17/
    - Centralize all composer libraries in the `devmaster/composer.json` file.
    - Add `composer_manager` module to allow modules to define their own dependencies using composer. 
    - Hook into hostmaster verify to trigger a `composer install` command to ensure the libraries are properly installed.
    - Switch from Admin Menu to NavBar! 
    - Fixed mobile breakpoint issues in the primary links! DevShop now works great on mobile screens.
    - Enable DevShop Permissions module by default so authenticated users can do most things. Patched hosting module to allow users to create sites even if they don't have an associated.
    - Disabled importing of "existing sites" when a platform is verified because this can be problematic. Some teams use `sites/something` for code but not site credentials.
    - Enable devshop_support_network_client module by default.
    - Fixed Devshop Acquia Hooks logging: needed to be updated to the latest p_log style instead of `devshop_log`.
    - Removed composer.json and committed vendor code from all modules.
    - Allow changing a project's default Git URL.
    - Fix missing error logs on project create wizard.
    - Fix errors on create project wizard and create environment form when logged in as a normal authenticated user: hosting_get_servers() uses node access checks unless extra parameter is set.
    - Show extra project drush aliases on the "clone source" field in the add environment form.
    - Add a _GET Parameter to allow links to decide whether or not to redirect to the task node when a task confirm form is fired.
    - On task pages, fix the task info header block to the top of the page when scrolled down.
    - Fix "Follow Logs" button, turn back into a button.
    - Added a "Run Again" button to tasks to allow easy triggering of the same task from task node pages.
    - Improve task logs pages in general: automatically enable "Follow Logs", improve button alignment.
    - Load site and platform context names into environment objects.
    - Added support for GitLab webhook payloads, so GitLab hosted environments only pull the environments for the branches that were pushed.
    - New Feature: Add remote drush aliases to Composer.json!
    - New Feature: Git Reset! Reset working copy changes from the web browser. 
    - Remove old unused code from devshop_testing_menu_alter
    - Totally new user login/password/register pages! 
    - Display a more clear error message when platform verification fails: "Codebase verification failed."
    - Add cancel button to task node page.
    
- Ansible Role improvements:
    - Added real .travis.yml testing to all roles.
    - https://github.com/opendevshop/ansible-role-aegir-apache/compare/1.1.0...master
    - Added `remi_php_repo_name` variable so RedHat users can decide their PHP version and removed hard coded php55 stuff in RedHat roles.
    - Fixed Ubuntu 16 installation, the `when` statements were incorrect. Added separate file for Ubuntu 14 variables.
    - Added a test for sudo apache reload access to the roles so it will fail early if sudo was misconfigured.
    - Moved `devmaster_install_command` and `devmaster_upgrade_command` to defaults/main.yml so they can be overridden.
    - Added `devshop_support_license_key` ansible variable.
    - Load `devmaster_site_root` and `devmaster_site_uri` as ansible facts, and use them to determine if we need to install or upgrade.
    - Stop `hosting-queued` service and kill all processes owned by aegir user before trying to change aegir user.
    - Fixed the Aegir sudo password prompt during install! Added `fix-drupal-*-ownership` and `fix-drupal-*-permissions` scripts. Somehow they are running even if module is not enabled.
    - Fix sudo configuration in aegir-nginx role.
    - Added behat tests for checking license key, HTTPS/LetsEncrypt servers, and the new homepage.
    - Use drupal_valid_path when checking for git commit visibility. It's more consistent that looking for permissions.



## 1.4.0 (September 27, 2018)

- 70 Commits to DevShop: https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/compare/1.3.4...1.4.0
- 85 Commits to Devmaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/7.x-1.34...7.x-1.40

- Added the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct: 
  > In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
  contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
  our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
  size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
  level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
  appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Created a new DevShop Composer Template to make it as easy as possible to get a project running in devshop! See https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop-composer-template for more information.

### UI Updates

- Implemented "Create a Branch" button and made sure "Create a tag" is enabled by default. Add a display of the current git reference to the Git Checkout and Git Tag form. Cleanup ordering, form element titles and descriptions, and allow a ?create=1 URL parameter to the Checkout task to change the UI to specifically target "Creation". <br>![Create Branches and Tags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106420/46040127-7d762400-c0dd-11e8-919f-c828ed0f55b0.png "A screenshot of the DevShop Environments new Create Branch and Tag buttons.")
- Replace missing "Last Commit" timestamp. <br>![Last commit timestamp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106420/46041552-0a6eac80-c0e1-11e8-942e-e1d32275b677.png "A screenshot of the DevShop Environments last commit timestamp.")
- Fixed bug preventing HTTP Authentication passwords from being saved.
- Enable LetsEncrypt.org support by default to provide free renewable HTTPS certficates.
- Enable DevShop Remote Aliases by default.
- Moved "Git Commit" interface out of devshop and into Hosting Git module.
- Moved "Aegir Features" module out of devshop and into Hosting Tasks Extra. 
- Moved `devshop_process()` to `provision_process()`, bringing another core feature of devshop to Provision/Aegir.
- Make environment variables available in `.hooks.yml` files.
- Change GitHub commit status name to `devshop/PROJECT/tests` and `devshop/PROJECT/deploy`. When the same project has the same Git URL, and you are PR driven development with automated testing, all projects were using the commit status name "devshop/tests". Now, the test results from every project is visible because they each get their own commit status.
- Fix writing project aliases when project is verified.
- Fixed the Download Modules task to work with composer-based projects! Now runs `composer require drupal/*` and commits in one shot!
- Cleaned up the new project page, giving examples of a SSH git URL, mentioning the option to use a full drupal stack or composer, linking to the [DevShop Composer Template](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop-composer-template).
- Allow editing of platform if the platform has not been verified.
- Fixed bug in ajax task loading that would load tasks for disabled sites.
- Fixed awkward display of Project and Environment links on Platform nodes.
- Moved the "Refresh Branches" button to the top of the Git Branches/Tags list dropdown.
- Upgrading Hosting Tasks Extras "Features Update & Revert" tasks with: 
    - Ability to specify which features to update or revert. 
    - Add "Force" option to "revert" task. 
    - Migrate all to provision_process(). 
    - Creating a hosting_tasks_extra.drush.inc file because that is the only place drush_hook_pre_hosting_task() works. 
    - Improving the form page: adding a form alter for easy page title renaming for other tasks.


### System Updates

- Hosting modules and Provision upgraded to 3.16. [Full release notes](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/release-notes/3.16/)

- Created a `robo up --mode=manual` option to allow for instantiating a container without running install.sh.
- Fixed the special makefile for travis forks.

- Fixed multiple issues with Ansible playbooks.

- Re-organizing makefiles so development makefile can stay separate and we don't have to modify on release. 
- Moving the development repos to a YML based makefile build-devmaster-dev.make.yml!
- Add `robo up --no-dev` option to build devmaster from build-devmaster.make. Otherwise, it uses build-devmaster-dev.make.yml. This is so devmaster's travis yml can still work.

## 1.0.0-rc2 (September 26 2017)

3 Commits to Devmaster https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/1.0.0-rc1...1.0.0-rc2

## 1.0.0-rc1 (September 25 2017)

Here it is!

Apologies for the long release cycle this time around. See below for more details on the previous release.

- 580 Commits to Devmaster https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/1.0.0-beta10...1.0.0-rc1
- 432 Commits to DevShop https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/1.0.0-beta10...1.0.0-rc1

### Updates 

- Update Drupal Core to 7.54.
- Update Drupal Contrib.
- Update Aegir Hosting modules to 3.12.0. Release notes available at: http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/release-notes/3.12/  (Please read, MANY huge improvements.)

### New Features

- Allow environment installation by multiple methods: Install profile, clone other environment, Import from SQL Database, or leave an Empty Database!
- Add Hosting HTTPS to allow automated certificate creation and renewal from LetsEncrypt.org.
- For Pull Request environments, add option to reinstall site on every git-push! This respects the "install method", allowing re-install of profile, re-sync from production, or import from external database!
- Added ability to "Change Site Domain Name" by using the "migrate" task.
- Configure a "Environment Domain Name Pattern" instead of "Base Url". Define your environment's URLs with a pattern like "@project.@environment.@hostname" or "@environment.domain.com".
- Make all URLs in Behat console output logs clickable. Useful in test results.
- Bigger, Bolder empty projects page.
- Plenty of UI enhancements:
    - Add "Install Method" and date to environment template.
    - Add Site Slogan back into page template.
    - Improve detection and messaging of environment state.

### Aegir improvements in 3.12.0

- Switch to using Semantic Versioning!  Aegir tag 7.x-3.120 is for Aegir 3.12.0
- Preparing Aegir for Docker hosting by allowing more open connections to Database servers: https://www.drupal.org/node/2794915
- Allow hostmaster install profile to be set in Debian package variable: https://www.drupal.org/node/2886587.  This will allow DevShop devmaster to start using the aegir hostmaster debian package.
- Added 'install_method' property to Aegir sites. If set to "profile", the default behavior (site install) executes. Set to something else to skip this and to flag it for something else later: https://www.drupal.org/node/2754069
- Add option to "provision-install" for "--force-reinstall". This new option will quickly delete the site and install it again using the original install_method. https://www.drupal.org/node/2836185

### Organization

- Moved Documentation to a dedicated repository: https://github.com/opendevshop/documentation
- Pushed devmaster back into drupal.org and refactored makefiles to make it more of a true distribution. See https://www.drupal.org/project/devmaster.
- Added a separate Makefile in YML for development: ensures all projects are downloaded with git.  (devmaster.development.make.yml)

### Subsystem Improvements

- Moved git handling to Aegir's Hosting Git Module! One more step towards moving devshop into Aegir. Platforms are now saved using the git ref from the project.
- Added a docker-compose.yml file for launching in Docker. Tuned for local development but can be adapted for production use.
- Added geerlingguy.composer Ansible role.
- Removed the last remnants of our custom Ansible role files: This MOTD template never worked, anyway! https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/376a74f9db5d154fad05d6083f0f402ac0f19fba/templates/motd.j2

### Testing Improvements

- Standardized on using `robo` commands for local dev and Travis testing.
- Removed old `tests/docker-launch.sh` and `tests/docker-destroy.sh` scripts, now that we have robo.
- Improved Travis CI testing: Now installs using Docker, and with Ansible, on both CentOS and Ubuntu. Upgrade is tested as well.
- Added `--name` option to `devshop devmaster:test` command to pass to bin/behat --name.
- Added `behat-path` option to `devshop devmaster:test` command to allow customizing which set of tests to run.
- Added `--makefile` option to `devshop upgrade` command to allow overriding the desired makefile.
- Moved Behat tests for DevShop to Devmaster, since most (all?) of the code being tested is actually in that repository. Makes changing tests to adapt to changing functionality much easier if its in the same repository.
- Removed custom Dockerfiles used for testing.
- On failure, echo last page source and watchdog logs.

### DevShop Development Tools Improvements
- Added a Robofile.php for easy launching and development. Install the Robo CLI and `robo up` to get a running devshop on Docker. See http://robo.li/ for more information.
- Deprecated the Vagrant based development environment, moving it into a subfolder.
- New `robo release` command to walk you through the release process!

### Other Improvements

- Fixed numerous bugs with Hosting Logs. Now you can easily make error logs available to uses, if needed.
- Fixed DevShop Deploy, Aegir Commit, DevShop Acquia, DevShop Dothooks, and Aegir Download module to work with repo_path instead of repo_root.
- Change the hook named `hook_devshop_environment_actions()` to `hook_devshop_environment_menu()`.f
- Fix 2 problems with BitBucket forms and webhooks. From new contributor @josebc! https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/pull/73
- Fix bug where "Import/Export Config" tasks would show for Drupal 7 sites. 
- Adding Features Update and Features Revert to Environment Menu.
- Temporarily removing "Fork Environment" feature, we will get it into Hosting Git in the next RC.
- In project drush aliases, just use 'parent' property to make our @project.env aliases work exactly like provision's.
-  Renamed devshop_drush_process() to devshop_process();
- Save environment settings into provision context data.
- Fix bug preventing branch names from having "/" characters.
- Removing custom drush command `devshop-install`. Now works with `hostmaster-install`.
- Add more details to automatically generated behat.yml files.
- Adding `--strict` to `bin/behat` command so that missing steps fail the process.
- Remove DevShop Deploy queue since Hosting Git Platforms now handles that.
- Enable fix_permissions and fix_ownership modules by default for better file management.
- Fix problem with cloning sites that used custom profiles.
- Remove loading of tons of git info from the command line for a significant performance boost.
- Removing old unused devshop-create and devshop-commit tasks.

## Ansible Playbooks

- Rewrote ansible installer using @geerlingguy's Ansible Playbooks.
- Created aegir.user, aegir.apache, aegir.nginx, and aegir.devmaster roles to finalize DevMaster installation.
  - https://github.com/opendevshop/ansible-role-aegir-user

- Improved install.sh script to work better on RedHat Enterprise Linux.
- Developed "Aegir Ansible" project, to be included in next release.  Allows Aegir to act as an Ansible Inventory, making setting up remote servers and adding additional playbooks and roles a breeze.

## New Features

- Git Submodules! Deploy tasks now run `git submodule update --init --recursive`, so if you want to keep certain modules in different git repos, devshop now makes that easy.
- Config Export and Import! DevShop & Aegir now give you a button to press to export your Drupal 8 config to files.  When you combine this with the Aegir Commit modules, you can Site Build, Export to disk, and commit to git without ever leaving your browser.
- Upgrade Drupal! Click the "Upgrade Drupal" button to run "drush pm-update" to get your core and contrib in line.
- Grouped Drush aliases! Each project now writes it's own drush aliases file, making it much easier to target an environment: 'drush @project.environment uli`

## D6 -> D7 Upgrade Fixes

- Fixed user redirection when running tasks. If fired from project dashboard, user is returned to project dashboard. If fired from environment dashboard, user is returned to environment dashboard.
- Fixed dynamic task status loading. Just sit back and watch tasks start and stop.
- Cleaned up styles for tasks widget, especially on the environments dashboard.
- A few missing links to the new hostmaster URL 'hosting_confirm/1' instead of node/1'
- Removed old unneeded CSS and JS.

### Newly Redesigned Tasks

- *Recreate Features* button allows you to update some or all of your Features modules in one click. Yes, this is an old feature, but it needed some dusting off. We've decoupled the "recreate" process from the "commit" process, making it much easier to avoid mistakes.
- *Download Modules* button allows you download and commit modules to git with the press of a button, or you can save your commit for the...
- *Commit* button, in the *Git Information* panel.  This task allows you to easily fill in a commit message and commit some or all of your changes. The name and user in DevMaster is automatically passed to git, so keep your devshop users accurate and you will have accurate git history.

These new features are not enabled by default, yet.  To check them out, please enable `aegir_features`, `aegir_download`, and `aegir_commit`.

### UI Improvements

- *Git Information* tells you when you have untracked, modified, added or deleted files. It will indicate if the repo is ahead or behind. Click for a modal window showing you the current git status, last commit, and full git diff for every environment.
- Git reference displayed on environments is now loaded in *realtime*. 
- *Situational Indicators* now tell you more about what is happening with your environments, especially when something failed.
- Situational buttons now appear on failed tasks or disabled environments giving you easy access to your options, such as 'View Logs & Retry', or 'Destroy Environment'.
- Improve `devshop status` command, it now fully bootstraps the devmaster site to ensure it is working and properly exits with a non-zero exit code if something fails.
- Output devmaster drupal version and site URL in `devshop status` command.
- Use `devshop status` and `devshop login` at end of install script, making it much more friendly.
- Moved all commands to use devshop_drush_process() and our new logging system, making all task logs beautiful.
- Added a `theme('devshop_ascii', $string)` function for easy beautiful ascii color in browser.
- Fixed the problem of GitHub Pull Request Environments often causing the "Clone" task to fail, which would prevent the environment from being created. In addition, "Deploy" task would not run on Cloned sites.  Now, new PR environments are exact clones of live, on the same git ref. After that, a new "Deploy" task is created that runs all appropriate deploy hooks.
- Clones of locked environments are automatically unlocked, since they are assumed to be destructible. Be sure to check your environment settings if you need to lock environments.
- Removing our special devshop_tests drupal page, and altering the menu to allow access to test tasks to users with the permission "access test logs". Now github links to the correct place to view tests in action!
- Fixed the funky "Logs" page for environments, and removed devshop_logs.module altogether!
- Added a [Tour](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/#tour) section to the documentation with screenshots.


### System & DevShop Development Features

- NGINX! You can now install NGINX + PHP-FPM on the devmaster server using the install script option `--server-webserver=nginx`.
- Full test suite running on Travis-ci.org, on both repositories, for both NGINX and Apache, Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS7!.  See https://travis-ci.org/opendevshop/devmaster and https://travis-ci.org/opendevshop/devshop for more info.
- Refactored travis tests and install scripts to allow testing of Pull Requests on devmaster repo.
- DevShop Behat tests now run through entire project creation, even testing the environment was installed properly.
- Created `docker-development-environment.sh` to launch a DevShop development environment in docker!  See `docker-destroy-devshop.sh` to remove the containers.
- Adding a 'devshop devmaster:test` command to the CLI for easy Behat testing of the front-end.
- Added command line options to `install.sh` script: 
  - `--server-webserver` can be `apache` or `nginx`.  
  - `--hostname` will pass a desired hostname to ansible, which will change the hostname on the system.
  - `--makefile` passes a different "build-devmaster.make" file, allowing for pull request testing.
  - `--aegir_user_uid` will pass to ansible variables, setting the aegir user to use the desired UID.


### New Contributors!

We're so excited to welcome Andrew Rosborough (@arosboro) from DropForgeLabs.com, and Daniel Hesoyam (@Hesoyam) to OpenDevShop as our newest contributors!

Andrew did immense work on tests, NGINX, and our 1.x branch upgrading devmaster to Drupal 7.

Daniel submitted a small patch fixing a warning in old versions of Vagrant.

## 0.7.0 (December 23, 2015)

71 commits to DevShop: https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0
20 commits to Devmaster: https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0

## DevMaster Fixes

- Fixed "Last Task" bug that was causing inconsistent environment status displays.
- Re-opening GitHub pull requests will recreate the environment.
- Fixed "Login" modal window bug that prevented users from being able to log in to all environments.
- Added "Environment Warnings" display that shows problems to the user, such as "No deploy hooks configured".
- When a major problem is detected, such as "Installation failed", "Clone failed", we now show the user a message describing what happened, and offer Retry and Destroy buttons so they can take immediate action.
- When an environment is being created, instead of saying "Verify" the first time, it says "Cloning codebase".
- Adding a VERSION.txt file to the install profile to define the project's version.  Once we go to Drupal 7 we can move this to the .info file. 

## DevShop CLI Fixes

- Fixed versioning issues! 
  - Banished the /var/aegir/.devshop-version file.  
  - Separated DevShop CLI and DevMaster versions in the status command.
  - Improved how devshop CLI interprets it's version.  If on a branch, it now specifies the SHA as well.
- Major CLI Improvements:
  - Added "self-update" command for the CLI that uses Git! Once Phar integration is complete self-update will update the phar as well.
  - Added our own Application and Command classes inspired by composer.  Moving a lot of shared code to those classes.
  - Added a sweet new logo for the CLI.
  - Set the stage for packaging devshop CLI into a PHAR file: added box.json.  We will not distribute the Phar file until we know self-update fully works.
  - Moved the executable from `devshop` to `bin/devshop`.

**NOTES:**
- After installing this release (once you have the self-update command), always run `devshop self-update` before `devshop upgrade`.  We will soon add code to enforce this by checking to see if devshop CLI is out of date before an upgrade.
- We do not remove the old .devshop-version file for you automatically, but the `devshop status` command will warn you if it still exists.  Please remove `/var/aegir/.devshop-version` manually.

## 0.6.0 (December 14, 2015)

## Web Developer Improvements
- Added "DevShop dotHooks" module: Add deploy hooks to your project's source code in a `.hooks` or `.hooks.yml` file.  Easily hook into any task: verify, install, deploy, test, etc.  See [docs.devshop.support](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/deployment-hooks/#devshop-dothooks) for more information.
- Added "DevShop Acquia" module: Use Acquia Cloud Hooks as deploy hooks in devshop. See [docs.devshop.support](http://docs.devshop.support/en/latest/deployment-hooks-acquia/) for more information.  We had partial support but now, all acquia cloud hooks are supported, and logging is much more clear.

## User Interface Improvements
- Total redesign of Tasks and logs: now we only output the logs that are pertinent to developers.
- Dynamic task logs loading for all types. Now you can sit back and watch your tasks run, with only the logs you want to see appearing.
- Renamed "Update Status" button to "Cancel Task". (TODO: Fail the task if the button is pushed.)
- Much improved deploy hooks configuration: 
  - Each environment now displays the deploy hooks that are configured, making it clear what is supposed to happen every time you deploy.
  - Project defaults are passed to all environments.
  - Block environment-specific deploy hooks.
  - Standardized deploy hook form across environment settings, deploy task, etc.
  - Automated deploy tasks respect all deploy hook types.
- Added settings form for "DevShop Public Key", in case you have to rebuild your devshop server's public key.
- Fixing problems with Aegir Download module.
- Fixed up some quirks with dynamically updating environment status.
- Created "Hosting Task Jenkins" module, allowing you to setup jenkins to run all of your tasks.  See [Hosting Tasks: Jenkins README](https://github.com/opendevshop/hosting_task_jenkins/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
- Lots of subtle design improvements.

## Internal Development Improvements
- Added hook_devshop_environment_alter(): Allow other modules to alter the environment object
- Added composer.json to devmaster and devshop_provision.
- Swapped drush_shell_exec's for Symfony Process in devshop_provision.
- Swapped provision-git-deploy for Symfony GitWrapper in devshop_provision and devshop_projects.drush.inc.  
- Added a new drush log type: devshop_command + devshop_log + devshop_ok + devshop_error.  These will output logs in a new prettier format in the front-end.  Documentation coming soon.
- Finally fully moving devshop_provision to [github](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop_provision), Created proper tags and branches and cleaned up old ones.
- Adding a shared function for adding the deploy hooks checkboxes to all forms that need it:  devshop_environment_deploy_hooks_form()
- Cleaned out a lot of old code and comments.

# Documentation Improvements

## Legacy

The changelog began with version 0.1.0 so any changes prior to that can be seen by checking the tagged releases and reading git commit messages.

Before 0.1.0, devshop releases were tagged as if it were a module: 6.x-1.x.

There was a long history of addon modules for aegir before devshop. 

### Hosting & Provision Logs (December 20, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_logs
https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_logs

Improved error log handling by setting Apache logs to an aegir-readable location, and making
them accessible to users through the devshop UI and a URL on the site.

### Hosting & Provision Solr (September 12, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_solr
https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_solr

This module allows Solr servers to be added to Aegir. Once you have a server, you can give an Aegir Site a Solr database as easily as choosing it's DB Server.

### DevMaster (September 9, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/devmaster

It wasn't until September of 2012 that we decided we needed a dedicated install profile, 
separate from Aegir's Hostmaster.

### DevShop Hosting (March 1, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/devshop_hosting

Provided the front-end interface for DevShop before it was merged into the DevMaster install profile project.

### DevShop Provision (March 1, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/devshop_provision

Provision drush commands for devshop. Still in use until 1.x release!

### Hosting Features (February 25, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_features

Allows Hostmaster users with the right permission to trigger a "Update & Commit Features" task. This re-creates all of a site's features (as in features.module features) and commits (and pushes) them

### Provision Git Features (February 25, 2012) 

https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_git_features

The backend commands that Hosting Features needs to work.

### Provision Git (February 21, 2012)

https://www.drupal.org/project/provision_git

Provides Provision with simple git commands.
