#@TODO: Remove this. It overrides everything, even hostvars.

# The default version of PHP to use.
# This must be 8.0 for now. Our containers are stuck at 18.04, which as of April 2023, no longer has any php packages available.
# The current play.yml doesn't run the PHP role on docker run so it doesn't fail.
# It does use this var to check that the right version of PHP is installed. This has to match the container image version to pass, since it won't install a new version.
# php_version: "8.0"
