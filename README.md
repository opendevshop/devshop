[DevShop][1] is an **Open Source DevOps Framework** and a 
set of reusable **components** designed to improve the web development, testing, and 
server management process.

The goal of DevShop is to provide a complete **web development & testing pipeline** out of the
box, while empowering users to choose their own server infrastructure and systems 
architecture.
 
DevShop uses [Ansible & Ansible Galaxy][2] for server configuration, [Symfony 
Console][3] for command line tools, and [Drupal][3] for the web interface.

### Core Values

#### Empower and Actualize.
  - Empower site builders to launch their own sites and services on any computer.
  - Actualize user's missions by freeing them from the burden of building their own platform

#### Simplify and Demystify.
  - Simplify the management of complex systems by defining core building blocks and designing components that work independently of the platform.
  - Demystify computing by maintaining configuration for the entire vertical stack, down to Linux and services, all the way up to container management platforms, hyper

#### Collaborate & Engage.
  - Collaborate with developers and systems administrators to build a product that fits their needs first.
  - Engage the community to work together towards the common goal of  a complete OpenOps platform and healthy ecosystem of tools.

#### Lower Costs & Barriers
  - Lower the cost of running sites with a host-agnostic platform, commoditizing servers, and moving maintenance costs of DevOps tools off of organizations and on to the community, 
  - Lower the barriers of entry into the DevOps world for all.


### Design Principles

The design principles of DevShop are transparency, simplicity, and modularity:


  - **Transparency:** *Control systems at the service level.* 
    
    DevShop manages services like 
    Apache and MySQL using Ansible to give total control to users. Docker images
    are built on top of that, using the same configuration. 
    
    This enables
    parity between traditional servers and the Docker containers, and allows 
    people to use DevShop along side tools they are familiar with like Ansible, Chef and Puppet.
  - **Simplicity:** *Avoid unneeded dependencies on build systems.* 
  
    DevShop manages servers and
    site code like a traditional web server, using Git, MySQL, and Apache to 
    maintain the broadest possible compatibility. 
    
    Build-based systems such as 
    Docker add time and complexity to the deployment process, prevent easy 
    access to servers, and force web developers to learn more skills and tools. 
    
  - **Modularity**: *Allow full customization of servers, processes, and interfaces.* 
  
    DevShop leverages Ansible for server 
    configuration and Drupal for the web interface, providing an easy way 
    to customize of all aspects of the system.
    
    DevShop follows the *core principles of Drupal:* community, collaboration, and
    customization. By following these guidelines, we hope to achieve a sustainable, 
    community-driven platform that can fit most users needs out of the box, without 
    restricting the rest from building their dream system.

## DevShop Components

The following components make up the OpenDevShop Framework:

1. Composer Packages
    1. [`devshop/git-split`](https://github.com/devshop-packages/git-split)
        - Commands to split the git monorepo into multiple child repos. 
        - Uses the same [splitsh-lite]() script that Symfony and Drupal uses.
        - Reads list of repositories from `composer.json` config.
        - In theory, could be used by Drupal core instead of the "drupalorg" scripts currently in use.
    2. [`devshop/composer-common`](https://github.com/devshop-packages/composer-common). Useful tools for any Composer project.
    3. [`devshop/power-process`](https://github.com/devshop-packages/power-process). Enhanced Symfony Process component.  
        - Improved command-line user experience, metadata reporting (executed time, PID, logs).
        - Pluggable output through monologger: pipe to screen, file, or remote monologger compatible REST API.
        - Base tool for the rest. Any shell execution should be done through PowerProcess.
        - Migrated from `provision-ops/power-process`.
    4. [devshop/github-api-cli](https://github.com/devshop-packages/github-api-cli) 
        - Simple CLI wrapper for the GitHub API.
        - Base command posts to any resource, passes any option.
        - Additional commands for specific purposes, such as to create and update "deployments".
    4. [`devshop/yaml-tasks`](https://github.com/devshop-packages/yaml-tasks)
        - Keep tests and standard commands in a Yaml file.
        - Run all commands with a single command.
        - Send command results to GitHub as Commit Status, to show pass/fail results in Pull Request pages.
        - Migrated from `provision-ops/yaml-tests`. 
1. Drupal Projects
    1. [`drupal/devmaster`](https://www.drupal.org): Pushed to drupal.org repo. Ensure compatibility with 
        Drupal.org packaging and composer packagist systems. 
3. Ansible Roles
    1. opendevshop.apache
    2. opendevshop.devmaster
    3. opendevshop.users
    4. devshop.server - Meta role used to create the `devshop/server` container.

DevShop is a "cloud hosting" system for Drupal. DevShop makes it easy to host, develop, test, and update drupal sites.  It provides a front-end built in Drupal ([Devmaster](https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster)) and a back-end built with Drush, Symfony, and Ansible.

DevShop deploys your sites using git, and allows you to create unlimited environments for each site.  DevShop makes it very easy to deploy any branch or tag to each environment

Code is deployed on push to your git repo automatically.  Data (the database and files) can be deployed between environments.  Run the built-in hooks whenever code or data is deployed, or write your own.

# Built on Aegir

DevShop utilizes the main components of the Aegir Hosting System: [Hosting](http://drupal.org/project/hosting) and [Provision](http://drupal.org/project/provision). It does not use [Hostmaster](http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster); it uses its own installation profile, [Devmaster](http://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster).  It does not use the theme, Eldir.  The default DevShop theme is called [Boots](https://github.com/opendevshop/devmaster/tree/7.x-1.x/themes/boots) and is included in the Devmaster install profile.

DevShop uses many additional contributed modules that Aegir core does not.
