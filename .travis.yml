  # This is how Travis clones the codebase:
  #    git clone --depth=50 https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop.git opendevshop/devshop
  #    cd opendevshop/devshop
  #    git fetch origin +refs/pull/355/merge:
  #    git checkout -qf FETCH_HEAD
  #
  #  If this is a PR, the $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH is set, and we must recreate the PR branch locally.
  #  Otherwise, the upgrade test fails because `devshop self-update` tries to checkout the branch but there's no commits.
