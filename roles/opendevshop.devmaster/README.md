The Drupal code for Devmaster is located at [drupal.org/project/devmaster](drupal.org/project/devmaster).

Requirements / Dependencies
------------

This role depends on the following addiitonal roles:

- [opendevshop.users](https://galaxy.ansible.com/opendevshop/users)
- [opendevshop.apache](https://galaxy.ansible.com/opendevshop/apache)
- [geerlingguy.composer](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/composer)
- [geerlingguy.php](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php)
- [geerlingguy.php-mysql](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php-mysql)

See the [DevShop Playbook.yml](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/1.x/playbook.yml) file for an example playbook.

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    server_hostname: local.devshop.site

The hostname to set for this server. The hostname should match a fully-qualified domain name that will resolve to the server you are using.

If using the install.sh script, this variable is either set from the `--hostname` option, or automatically detected from the `hostname -f` command.

*NOTE:* You could use Ansible to create the DNS records with your own playbook. See [DNSimple](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/dnsimple_module.html), [DigitalOcean Domains](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/digital_ocean_domain_module.html), or [Route53](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/route53_module.html), [Azure DNS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/azure_rm_dnsrecordset_module.html#azure-rm-dnsrecordset-module), or [other](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_all_modules.html?highlight=DNS) Ansible modules.

    devshop_devmaster_email: admin@devshop.local.computer
    
The email address to use for the Devmaster Dashboard user account #1. Default to `admin@devshop.local.computer`

    devshop_cli_repo: http://github.com/opendevshop/devshop.git
    
The git repository to use for the CLI and Ansible roles data. 

    devshop_cli_path: /usr/share/devshop
    
The path to install the CLI code to. 

    devshop_cli_update: true
    
Set to "no" to block updating the `devshop_cli_path` to the `devshop_version`.


### install.sh script

The recommended way to install DevShop is with the [install.sh](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/1.x/install.sh)
 
 script, but these roles also work if the variables are set correctly.

The install script prepares certain variables and runs this playbook.


Example Playbook
----------------

The devshop install.sh script uses this [playbook.yml](https://github.com/opendevshop/devshop/blob/1.x/playbook.yml) file:

```yml
##
# DevShop: DevMaster Server with Apache
#

---
- hosts: all
  user: root
  roles:
    - opendevshop.users
    - opendevshop.apache
    - geerlingguy.php
    - geerlingguy.php-mysql
    - geerlingguy.composer
    - opendevshop.devmaster
```
