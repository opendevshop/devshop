 # @TODO: Remove or re-implement. This is no longer being used.
## Use this file to alter variables in the devshop container.
#server_hostname: devshop.local.computer
#
## Uncomment to reinstall hostmaster instance on every robo up.
## I'm leaving this commented because otherwise it would reinstall every time.
## If you want to reinstall on robo up, use `bin/robo up --force-reinstall`
## devshop_control_install_options: --force-reinstall
#
## Set these to your local UID so docker paths map correctly.
## IF you set $AEGIR_USER_UID that will be used instead.
#aegir_user_uid: 1000
#aegir_user_gid: 1000
